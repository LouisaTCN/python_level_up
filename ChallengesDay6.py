# def pin_checker(user_pin):
#     if user_pin == "1234":
#          return True
# else:
#     return False

# def cash_withdrawal(amount,user_pin):
#     if pin_checker(user_pin):
#         print("you can withdraw {amount}")
# else:
#     print("Your pin was incorrect")

# def change_pin(newpin, user_pin):
#     if pin_checker(user_pin):
